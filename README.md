When you run the program it will ask you how many participants are in your Secret Santa gift exchange and then ask for the names one by one. After it randomizes the list
it'll generate a text file on your desktop with the days date. 

I wrote this because my S.O initially asked me be the person who drew the names for her Secret Santa group and I wanted a fun little challenge for myself.
